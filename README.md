Nano is a library for rapidly building Net 8.0 applications.  

The project is inspired by years of tedious repetitions, continuously re-writing similar code-snippets and libraries, to handle common functionality, not related to the business domain, such as logging, data persistence, message queuing, documentation, validation and similar.

#### Aspects and Benefits
The aspects and benefits of Nano, can be summarized as follows.
* Provides configurable implementations for non-business related aspects of an application, 
* Combining the best practices, patterns, extensions and conventions of modern development. 
* Inject providers and register custom dependencies.
* Override, extend or disable any part of Nano, not suitable for the application. 
* Derive concrete implementations, enriched with functionality, from base abstractions and interfaces, for all parts of the application.  
* Avoid wasting valuable development resources, on matters not related to the business.
* Remain focused on modelling data and operations of the business domain.
